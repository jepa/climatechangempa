# Abstract

Marine ecosystems face many threats including pollution, overfishing and climate change. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are one of the most common tools of spatial management and when effective, can protect and re-establish healthy ecosystems while promoting sustainability. However, as climate change shifts species distributions around the world, MPAs purported benefits, including increased biomass within the protected area and fisheries catch and revenue in the form of spillover, may be threatened. This is of specific concern to areas in the tropics where climate change effects are expected to be stronger but also to extra-tropical regions where distribution of fish are expected to expand into. Here we evaluate whether and to what extent MPAs will continue to provide biomass and fishing benefits under climate change. We undertake this analysis by modifying an existing species distribution model to account for the effects of fishing closures from MPAs. We find that climate change will negatively affect fish stocks in most tropical and subtropical MPAs; however, MPAs in these regions mitigate losses in stock biomass and revenue when compared to a scenario without MPAs. While the benefits from MPAs under climate change are most significant in higher latitudes, tropical MPAs will still provide significant benefits, even under a high emission scenario.

# Introduction

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are among the most popular tools for conservation [@Song:2017iua]. MPAs can be fully or partially no-take and lead to increases in population biomass [@Friedlander:2017bt; @Chirico:2017dfa], density [@Chirico:2017dfa], resilience [@Micheli:2012he], individual size [@Chirico:2017dfa; @Micheli:2012he], and species diversity within MPA boundaries [@Chirico:2017dfa; @Halpern:2002fe; @Halpern:2003uz; @Gell:2003ko; @Micheli:2004fp]. Such effects can lead to spillover of adult fish biomass in waters up to 150 kilometers away [@Tremain:2004ul], in some cases increasing fish yield [@Halpern:2010kj]. All of these benefits, however, are context and factor dependent. Diverse human activities such as coastal runoff [@Crain:2009tx], illegal fishing [@Dalton:2015it; @Dureuil:2018fq], water pollution [@Schiff:2011fq], and climate change [@Bruno:2018cs] threaten conservation goals of MPAs. Moreover, governance and design factors such as effective enforcement of the boundaries and rules, size of the protected area, and time of establishment are keys to achieving conservation goals [@Edgar:2014fia]. In terms of design, some MPAs like the Channel Island Marine Sanctuary, off the coast of California, constitute networks of protected areas [@Rassweiler:2020bp], while others have dynamic boundaries such as the near real-time dynamic spatial management of southern bluefin tuna bycatch by the eastern Australian pelagic longline fishery [@Hobday:2006bq]. However, today most MPAs are a single polygon and static in nature, representing a fixed area in the ocean with invisible borders [@Gaines:2010dw]. This is of particular concern as species shift their known distribution while coping with a changing world. As climate change shifts ecosystem dynamics and species distributions, marine protected areas may play a key role in mitigating the impacts of ocean warming on species and the communities that depend on them.  


The ocean has absorbed 90% of the excess heat produced by greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution leading to a global increment of $0.11^oC$ in sea surface temperature per decade [@Rheim:2013fv; @IPCC:2019to]. Additionally, the ocean has captured about 30% of the carbon emissions, which has increased the water acidity by 26% and produced a total oxygen loss of 3.3% relative to the 1980s, among other physicochemical changes [@Rheim:2013fv]. Marine species are deeply related to their environment and thus these changes have had repercussions on all ecological levels from individuals (e.g., changes in length [@Pauly:2017hpa]) to ecological communities (e.g., species composition [@Scheffers:2016gz]). Marine species have adopted different strategies to cope with these changes with many shifting their known distribution following the environmental conditions favorable for their development [@Poloczanska:2016kk]. Across a wide range of taxonomic groups (e.g., tunas [@ErauskinExtramiana:2019fw], flounders, and lobsters [@Pinsky:2012kq; @Pins:2013ab]), marine species have expanded their distribution by about 72 km per decade [@Poloczanska:2016kk]. Moreover, results from modeling exercises suggest that such shifts are projected to continue under climate change [@Cheung:2010dt; @Barange:2014kr], even under a low-emission scenario as proposed in the Paris Agreement [@Cheung:2016tt]. 

Social-ecological systems will also be affected by the impacts of climate change on marine species. Climate change is expected to affect the economics of fishing [@Lam:2016dy], revenues from tourism [@Weatherdon:2016ws], food security and the overall health of coastal communities [@Golden:2016gd]. The ecological effects of climate change are projected to be more intense at equatorial latitudes [@Gattuso:2015jz], a region where most MPAs have been implemented [@UNEPWCMC:2019tc]. The movement of species tracking temperature gradients [@Pins:2013ab] directly threatens conservation outcomes as most MPAs are not designed with shifting species ranges in mind [@FredstonHermann:2018kp]. Moreover, these impacts could have a cascading effect on social-ecological systems, such as fishing and ecotourism, that depend on MPAs and their benefits from biological spillover.

Given the threats of climate change on marine species and the potential use of MPAs as a regulatory tool for promoting biodiversity and abundance, it is essential that we understand the effects of currently established MPAs and their potential to mitigate negative impacts of climate change. While tropical MPAs may suffer the most under climate change, evidence suggests that, in some cases, these MPAs could still provide benefits to communities in the future [@Davies:2017ii; @McLeod:2009cl; @Micheli:2012he]. However, the potential for current MPAs to mitigate climate change impacts has yet to be assessed in terms of biodiversity and fisheries loss. Addressing the level of effectiveness that current MPAs will have under different climate change scenarios is critical, especially as the world moves toward establishing new conservation areas within countries’exclusive economic zones and in areas beyond national jurisdiction [@OrtunoCrespo:2019df; @Maxwell:2020is] by 2030 [@IISD:2020te]. 

This paper seeks to project the impacts of shifts in species distributions under climate change scenarios on some of the ecological and economic outcomes of existing MPAs. We build upon previous assessments of the environmental impacts of climate change on fish biomass, catches, and MPAs [@Bruno:2018cs; @Cheung:2010dt; @Cheung:2016hf] with outputs from three Earth System Models as well as global databases of MPAs and fisheries catches and economics to project the responses of exploited marine species and their implications for fisheries revenues worldwide under scenarios of climate change (high and low mitigation) [@IPCC:2019to] and MPAs (with and without). We then examine the effects of MPAs in affecting changes in fish stocks and fisheries.


# Methods

We projected the distribution of 963 commercially important marine species under climate change for the whole globe using an already established dynamic bioclimate envelope model (hereafter referred as DBEM) [@Cheung:2010dt]. These species cover 47% of the taxa included in the *Sea Around Us* catch database, representing 97% of the catch identified at the species' level, and 56% of the world catch (e.g., including categories such as "Miscellaneous fin fishes") between 2010 and 2014 [@Zeller2016]. We ran two iterations of the DBEM, one similar to previous studies [@Cheung:2009ud; @Cheung:2010dt] where there were no MPAs and a scenario where MPAs reduced the fishing mortality (hereafter referred as the no-MPA Model and MPA Model, respectively).

The DBEM uses species depth limits, northern and southern latitudinal range limits, and species’ association with major habitat types to predict current distribution, and by considering species’ ecophysiology, growth and spatial population dynamics to project future changes in biomass and production under changing ocean conditions. The model predicts biomass and maximum catch potential (MCP, a *proxy* of maximum sustainable yield) of the modeled species at a $0.5^o$ latitude by $0.5^o$ longitude scale (See Cheung et al., 2010 and 2016 for model details). There are two key underlying processes in the DBEM relevant to the present study; species-specific patterns of larval dispersal between cells and fishing mortality within each cell. These processes were used to model the effect of an MPA in fish biomass.

In the DBEM, larval dispersal from one cell to another is driven by ocean current and diffusion, assuming that the recruitment magnitude is related to the larval duration in the water column [@Oconnor:2007vi], strength and direction of water currents and diffusivity [@Cheung:2016jd]. The pelagic larval duration will be shorter in warmer waters; however, longer when the average water temperature of a species distribution is high [@Oconnor:2007vi]. The instantaneous rate of larval mortality and settlement ($\lambda$) is estimated by: 

<!-- $$\lambda = M + S$$  -->
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
\lambda = M + S
\end{equation}

where *M* and *S* are the natural mortality and settlement rates of larvae, respectively. We tested the capacity of larvae  to diffuse within the water column, settle in each grid cell, and survive in the water column. In the case of diffusion, which is species dependent, we modeled each species’ value $\pm$ 5% and 10%. For larvae settlement and suitability (original values at 0.15 $day^{-1}$) we ran the model for 0.05, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.25 $day^{-1}$. We estimated the differences between the MPA model and the no-MPA model (e.g. Figure 2) for each variable and found that our results are robust to such parameters (Figure S1). The sensitivity analysis was undertaken using the GFDL model uner a low emission scenario.

We used the United Nations Environment World Conservation Monitoring Center’s World Database on Protected Areas of December 2018 [@UNEPWCMC:2019tc]. Only the MPAs labeled as “no-take” by the WDPA were included. The WDPA defines *no-take* as the complete halt of extracting any living or dead natural resources, inclusive of all methods of fishing, extraction, dumping, dredging and construction, is strictly prohibited in all or part of a MPA [@UNEPWCMC:2019tc]. In total, we selected 596 no-take (total or partial) marine and coastal MPAs (Table S1). We gridded the WDPA onto a $0.5^o$ latitude by $0.5^o$ longitude map of the world ocean to harmonize the MPA dataset with spatial structure of DBEM. We classified the cells that contain an MPA as *protected waters* (cells that fully or partially contained an MPA). Also, cells that were surrounding an MPA cell were classified as *surrounding waters*  while all other ocean cells are considered *unprotected*. The spatial designation analysis was conducted in ArcMap 10.6.1. We then estimated the proportion of each grid cell that contained a no-take MPA using the “tabulate intersection” tool in ArcMap 10.6.1

In DBEM, MPAs were represented by a reduction in the fishing mortality of any given cell. When the spatial cell is covered entirely by MPA, fishing mortality in that cell was set to zero. When the area of an MPA was smaller than the area of the grid cell ($0.5^o$ by $0.5^o$) we estimated the proportional size of the MPA relative to the grid cell and reduced fishing mortality by such proportion ($\alpha$). Fishing mortality ($\widehat{F}$) for each species in each cell was defined as follows,

<!-- $$\hat{F} = F_{MSY}*(1-\alpha)$$ -->

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2}
\hat{F} = F_{MSY}*(1-\alpha)
\end{equation}

where $F_{MSY}$ is the DBEM estimated fishing mortality and $\alpha$ is the proportion of the grid cell covered by any given MPA. In the DBEM, fisheries catch outside of MPAs is determined by the fishing mortality that would yield the MCP (approximately Fmsy) and therefore does not incorporate direct or indirect changes in fishing effort [@Cheung:2010dt].


We calculated biomass and MCP for each species using the climate forcings of three Earth System Models (ESM): the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model 2M (GFDL, https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/earth-system-model/), the Institute Pierre Simon Laplace Climate Model 5 (IPSL-CM5, http://cmc.ipsl.fr/ipsl-climate-models/ipsl-cm5/), and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI, http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/models/). Results were averaged by time periods representing the present day (1995-2014), the mid $21^{st}$ century (2041-2060) and the end of the $21^{st}$ century (2081-2100) to reduce climate variability. We included two climate change scenarios following two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: a low greenhouse gas emissions (strong mitigation, RCP 2.6) and a high emission (no mitigation, RCP 8.5) scenario [@IPCC:2019to]. The RCP 2.6 is a strong mitigation greenhouse gas emissions scenario, which by the end of the $21^{st}$ century is projected to lead to a net radiative forcing of 2.6 $Wm^{-2}$. The RCP 8.5 is a high business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions scenario that projects a net radiative forcing of 8.5 $Wm^{-2}$ by the end of this century. These RCP’s represent extreme climate change scenarios according to the IPCC, capturing the main spectrum of possible societal actions regarding mitigation used by the IPCC. Final results are presented as the average $\pm$ s.d. of the ESM to capture the structural uncertainty between models.

We linked historical current and past catch and ex-vessel price data with the future change in MCP from the DBEM to estimate fisheries revenue. Historical fisheries catch data was obtained from the *Sea Around Us* database available at (www.searound.org). The *Sea Around Us* has reconstructed fisheries catches for all maritime countries and territories in the world from 1950 to present [@Zeller2016]. Fisheries catches were spatially assigned and allocated by species and habitat distributions to the same global $0.5^o$ latitude by $0.5^o$ longitude grid system as the DBEM. In addition to catch, we use the ex-vessel price for each species, caught by each country, in each year from  a reconstructed ex-vessel price database [@Tai2017]. We assume that future ex-vessel prices are the same as present ex-vessel prices and that the proportion of catch of a species in a cell caught by a particular country will remain the same in the future and is calculated as the average value for the previous ten years (2005-2014). 

Thus, we estimate fisheries revenues as the weighted average price multiplied by the MCP change in each cell. As countries have different prices for different species, we used current catch proportions by country and species in each cell to derive a weighted average price per tonne for each species. The weighted price was established using the proportion of each country’s current catch multiplied by the country-species specific price. We calculated the existence value as the potential ex-vessel value of the species (their current ex-vessel price multiplied by their biomass). Finally, for each DBEM-Model we aggregated the biomass, MCP, and revenue of all species modeled by grid cell and RCP.

To determine the effects of climate change in MPAs we evaluate the percentage change ($\Delta V$) in the above variables (biomass, MCP, and revenue) between three time periods (present, mid century, and end of the $21^{st}$ century) and between MPA models (outputs from the MPA model compared to those of the no-MPA model) as follows,

<!-- $$ \Delta V = \frac{V_{x}-V_{y}}{\frac{V_{x}+V_{y}}{2}}*100 $$ -->

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:3}
\Delta V = \frac{V_{x}-V_{y}}{V_{x}}*100
\end{equation}

where $V_{x}$ is the variable at present time, or the result from the no-MPA model and $V_{y}$ is the variable at mid or end of the $21^{st}$ century, or the variable from the MPA model. As an arbitrary rule, for all cases where  $V_{x}$ = 0 but $V_{y}$ > 0, $\Delta V$ = 100, contrarily, if $V_{x}$ > 0 but $V_{y}$ = 0, $\Delta V$= -100, and vice versa, naturally if both $V_{x}$ and $V_{y}$ = 0, then $\Delta V$ = 0. 

All of the data analysis and statistics were made with the statistical software *R* version 3.6.2 (2019-12-12). Data from both the MPA and no-MPA models were not normally distributed presenting high skewness and a sharper peak (leptokurtic according to the kurtosis test done with the *moments* package in *R* [@PackagemomensMome:2015uh]). We explored the potential spatial autocorrelation of grid cells by computing the data semivariance (e.g. semi-variogram) using the *R* package *nlme* [@PackagenlmeLinear:2020ut]. Spatial autocorrelation is a process by which similarity between neighbouring spatial data (in our case grid cells) could influence the results of statistical analyses [@Haining:2001dg]. For this process, the time-present abundance data of the MPA model under RCP 2.6 was used assuming that the correlation level would be similar in all versions since they come from the same overarching model (DBEM). An initial subset of 5000 grids was made and then fitted with a linear model using a generalized least squares approach and maximizing the restricted log-likelihood (REML method) [@PackagenlmeLinear:2020ut]. Subsequently, we generated  a variogram of the model to determine the level of spatial autocorrelation. This process was repeated 100 times (in each process a new random subset of data was used for a total of 500000 grids tested) and finally averaged. The results of the semivariogram shows evidence of spatial autocorrelation as values increase up to a point (y axis) before plateauing around 100 km (Figure S2). Therefore, we averaged  all grid cells that were within 100 km (~1 degree) distance (using the *aggregate* function from the *raster* package in R [@PackagerasterGeog:2018ua]). All statistical analyses were done with the data corrected for autocorrelation. 

We statistically tested our results to answer four main questions. First, to understand the effectiveness of MPAs in mitigating climate change we performed a Chi-squared test. This allowed us to explore significant differences in the direction by which abundance and MCP would change (positive or negative). Using only the MPA model we identified the biome (coastal or oceanic tropical, temperate and polar) that each MPA was implemented [@Reygondeau:2019uh]. We separated coastal and oceanic temperate and polar biomes in north and south. We then counted the amount of protected and non-protected grid cells that were projected to decrease in MCP (e.g. $\Delta MCP$ < 0) and those that will increase or stay the same (e.g. $\Delta MCP$ >= 0) by the mid and end of the $21^{st}$ century, relative to present time. Grid cells were tested by protection category and biome separately (e.g. one test for protected grid cells containing an MPA in coastal tropical biome and one test for surrounding in the same biome) at each time step. The second test was directed to understand whether having an MPA would still be more beneficial than not having one under climate change. To answer this we employed the non-parametric two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing the MPA and no-MPA model for protected grid cells (e.g. protected grid cells of the MPA model vs the same cells of the no-MPA model in a time period). The same test was then used to compare the surrounding grid cells between the MPA and the no-MPA model to detect the spillover effect. All open ocean grid cells were located > 200 km from any protected grid cell corrected for autocorrelation, thus comparing the effects of the MPA in these cells would be ecologically unsound as the spatial extent of spillover effects is substantially closer to MPAs [@Halpern:2010kj]. Finally, we created a series of linear regression models to explore potential latitudinal effects on the changes in abundance and catch. The following *R* packages were used at some point of the analysis *data.table* [@Packagedatatable:2019uh], *wesanderson* [@Packagewesanderson:2018vn], *cowplot* [@CowplotStreamlined:2019wt], *ggpubr* [@Packageggpubrggp:2018tv], *kableExtra* [@PackagekableExtra:2019td], *knitr* [@PackageknitrAGen:2020wta], *sf* [@PackagesfSimpleF:2018vp], *sp* [@PackagespClasses:2019tn], *tidiverse* [@PackagetidyverseE:2017vq], *tidytext* [@PackagetidytextTe:2019vk], and *zoo* [@PackagezooSInfr:2019tm].

# Results

Projections from the MPA model suggest that many of the current no-take MPAs are in areas that will experience major changes in biomass under climate change - specifically the poles and tropics (Figure 1). Under a high emission scenario by mid $21^{st}$ century, tropical waters within MPAs are expected to lose over 50% of biomass relative to today. This is the case of the Arnavon Islands in the Solomon Islands (-65.14% $\pm$ 31.6) and Jaluit in the Marshall Islands (-52.86 $\pm$ 10.26). Keeping emissions to lower levels could reduce the impacts by half, with average biomass changes of -32.8 $\pm$ 18.5 in waters within Arnavon and -23.9 $\pm$ 7.2 within Jaluit. In contrast, as species shift their distributions poleward, most MPAs outside of the tropics are expected to see an increase in biomass of over 100%, regardless of the scenario. This is the case of the Pitcairn Islands Marine Reserve in Pitcairn Islands (United Kingdom) and the Walrus Islands over the coast of Alaska, USA. Towards the end of the $21^{st}$ century, changes in biomass will intensify under the high emission scenario while less of a change is expected under the low emission scenario. For example, waters within the MPAs of Bikini in Marshall Islands and the South Ari MPA in the Maldives are expected to lose -96.84 % $\pm$ 7.7 and -96.52% $\pm$ 7 of fish biomass, respectively under a high emission scenario. In this case, a low emission scenario would result in an average biomass reduction of -20.63% $\pm$ 16 for Bikini and -22.46 $\pm$ 6.5 for South Ari (Figure S3).

Results from the MPA model suggest that when comparing today’s biomass to the mid and end of the $21^{st}$ century, areas both containing and surrounding MPAs will see a decrease through time towards the end of the $21^{st}$ century regardless of the climate change scenario (Figure 2). Overall, surrounding cells will see a stronger decrease while both proteted and surrounding waters will be more impacted under a high emission scenario. While some cases will see changes larger than $\pm$ 50%, globally speaking the range will fall between $\pm$ 10%, except for the end of the $21^{st}$ century where a high emission scenario will result in surrounding waters ranging from +5 to -40%.

Most MPAs in this study are located in the tropics and the southern temperate biomes and will be impacted differently depending on the location, climate change scenario, and time frame (Figure 3A). If MPAs were overall effective in addressing climate change by mid and the end of the $21^{st}$ century, the change in abundance relative to today in grid cells containing MPAs and surrounding waters should show a greater proportion of positive change. The Chi-squared goodness of fit test showed significant differences across biomes, climate change scenario and time frame, although exceptions exists (Figure 3B). Specifically, MPAs and surrounding waters in the tropical coastal biome where the only group with significant differences in the distribution of change across all time frames and climate change scenarios (Figure 3B). In the tropical oceanic areas, all but MPAs under a high emission scenario at mid $21^{st}$ century were also significantly different. On the other hand, polar coastal MPAs had the fewer significant differences across climate change scenarios and time frames (See Table S2 for full statistics). Overall, the distribution of biomass change varied depending on the climate change scenario, grid cell type, and biome. For example, under a high emission scenario, MPAs and surrounding waters of the tropical and northern temperate oceanic biome will see a decrease in biomass by the mid $21^{st}$ century while a low emission scenario will keep biomass unchanged or slightly increasing, probably due to a lesser species poleward displacement. This differentiation is more evident by the end of the $21^{st}$ century were a high emission climate change scenario will result in substantially larger losses relative to today (Fig 3B). On the other hand MPAs and surrounding waters of the southern temperate oceanic biome where most MPAs are located, will see a larger increase in biomass if emissions are not reduced in both the middle and the end of the $21^{st}$ century, and this is likely the result of species being displaced from the tropics and into southern areas (Figure 3B). The time frame will also influence the distribution of biomass change. Tropical coastal and oceanic MPAs are expected to suffer greater losses by the end of the $21^{st}$ century relative to the present if emissions continue to be high, while the change will be minimal if emissions are mitigated. On the contrary, southern polar (where fishing is not common today) and temperate southern MPAs and surrounding waters are expected to gain biomass by the end of the $21^{st}$ century, if society follows a high emission scenario. In almost all cases, however, the distribution of benefits is larger under a high emission scenario and by the end rather than the middle of the $21^{st}$ century (Figure 2, 3B).

When statistically comparing the no-MPA model to the MPA model, we found that regionally, the presence of MPAs can reduce losses to species biomass and fisheries catch under climate change in the mid $21^{st}$ century, even under a high emission scenario (Figure 4). Under this scenario, biomass is significantly higher within MPAs (Wilcoxon-test, *W* = `r Biomass_MPA`, *p* < 0.001, *n* = 3123) and surrounding waters (Wilcoxon-test, *W* = `r Biomass_Surro`, *p* < 0.001, *n* = 2814) in the MPA scenario compared to the no-MPA scenario (Figure 4A). While catch is significantly higher in surrounding waters due to the biomass spillover effect (Wilcoxon-test, *W* = `r Catch_Surro`, *p* = 0.004, *n* = 2814) fishing revenue is significantly lower in both surrounding (Wilcoxon-test, *W* = `r Revenue_Surro`, *p* < 0.001, *n* = 2814) and protected cells (Wilcoxon-test, *W* = `r Revenue_MPA`, *p* < 0.001, n = 3123) in the MPA scenario (Figure 4B). These results will intensify towards the end of the $21^{st}$ century (Figure S4). It is worth mentioning that the reduction of fishing revenue in protected cells is the result of fishing mortality not being completely removed but reduced in these grid cells proportional to the MPA cover (e.g., from 0.2 in the no-MPA model to 0.1 in the MPA model for an MPA that covers half the grid cell - see Methods). Lastly, no significant difference was detected when comparing non-protected regions for all three variables (Biomass, Wilcoxon-test, *W* = `r Biomass_Unp$statistic`, *p* = `r round(Biomass_Unp$p.value,3)`; Catch, Wilcoxon-test, *W* = `r Catch_Unp$statistic`, *p* = `r round(Catch_Unp$p.value,3)`; Revenue, Wilcoxon-test, *W* = `r Revenue_Unp$statistic`, *p* = `r round(Revenue_Unp$p.value,3)`; *n* = 36461). The benefits of MPAs significantly increase with increasing latitude. Under a high emission scenario, the percentage change in biomass within MPAs (between the MPA and no-MPA model) will increase with (absolute) latitude in (DF = 1:2299, *F* = 1043, R2 =.3119, *p* < 0.001, *n* = 6785). Similarly, in surrounding waters (DF = 1:2760, *F* = 281.4, R2 = 0.92, *p* < 0.001, *n* = 6785), although the model only captures 9% of the data variation. In the case of revenue in surrounding waters, latitude did not explain the percentage changes (DF = 1:2759, *F* = 0.02071, R2 = 0.0, *p*  = 0.885, *n* = 3567) despite showing an increase at lower latitudes (Figure 4C). Such an effect is not as obvious in the open ocean as latitude only explains 1.6% of the variance in the percentage change in biomass (DF = 1:35086, *F* = 577, R2 = 0.016, *p* < 0.001, *n* = 141568).

# Discussion

We found that the implementation of marine protected areas to a pre-existing global model resulted in similar global trends in biomass and catch potential, with increases in higher latitudes and decreases in the tropics [@Cheung:2009ud; @Cheung:2016jd]. While our results demonstrate that on an aggregate global level, MPAs will not completely counteract the effects of climate change, locally, areas within MPAs are projected to have lower climate change impacts. These results suggest that areas within MPAs could be buffered from the expected negative impacts of climate change on biomass until the mid $21^{st}$ century. However, there are limits to the extent to which the MPA can avoid climate impacts on fish stocks and fisheries, particularly in the most sensitive regions such as tropical oceans.


On a regional, while creating no-take MPAs exclude fishing, biological spillover from the MPA will help to increase fishing revenue and biomass in surrounding areas even under future climate change [@Halpern:2010kj]. Such spillover effect was supported by our modelling outputs in which biomass, catches and revenues were higher in areas from an MPA (relative to no-MPA) under a high emission climate change scenario (Figure 3). The estimated distance with spillover effect (average of 110 km from an MPA) is an approximation as the calculated spillover effect distance is dependent on the resolution of the model. However, our estimation falls within the magnitude of observed spillover effects as previous studies reported distance with significant spillover ranging from 2 to 150 km from an MPA [@Tremain:2004ul; @Halpern:2010kj].

Our results also demonstrate that MPA can amply the potential gains in biomass and catches from climate change particularly in higher latitude regions. In conjunction with previous studies [@Cheung:2009ud; @BryndumBuchholz:2019kh], our results suggest that as species move from the tropics to polar regions, the higher latitudes will experience major gains in biomass and revenue potential. Therefore, high-latitude MPAs protect these incoming species, which could amplify the benefits to fisheries revenue. Thus, the creation of new MPAs in these regions could have positive outcomes for established species and future biomass “arriving” to the region. However, climate change projections for polar regions are subjected to larger levels of uncertainty than other regions [@IPCC:2019to]. For example, a recent study projecting climate change impacts on marine biomass employing six marine ecosystem models found the greatest model disagreement in the Arctic [@BryndumBuchholz:2019kh]. Such uncertainty exists in our analysis and must be considered when deciding where to implement MPAs.

While species are shifting towards the poles, our results demonstrate that MPAs in the tropics are evermore important as these areas will experience the greatest losses under climate change [@Bruno:2018cs]. The presence of MPAs in the tropics can help to alleviate losses, as protected areas in these regions still contribute to some climate risk-reduction to fisheries. However, these protected areas cannot fully combat the expected range shifts of marine fished species and their resultant effect on fisheries biomass and revenues. In addition to the benefits of MPAs on biomass and revenue, many documented benefits of well-managed MPAs are likely to continue under climate change including areas as refugia from the effects of fishing leading to older and larger populations, ecosystem resilience and diversity, and carbon sequestration, thus promoting adaptation of social-ecological systems to climate change [@Roberts2017]. Some of these benefits have been the result of empirical analysis showing that marine reserves can increase local populations’ resilience and recovery in the face of climate change [@Micheli:2012he].  Therefore, the implementation of MPAs by tropical coastal nations could still provide some benefits under climate change and that our study’s projected benefits of MPAs to biomass and revenue could also impact other ecosystem functions.  

Previous studies have hypothesized that MPAs with fixed borders will not be able to fully protect species that shift their known distribution to cope with a changing ocean [@FredstonHermann:2018kp; @Bruno:2018cs]. Our results support this hypothesis for most MPAs, especially those located in the tropics. Dynamic MPAs that shift their border following climate change, large MPAs, and networks of protected areas are possible solutions to protect the redistribution of species under climate change [@FredstonHermann:2018kp; @McLeod:2009cl; @Davies:2017ii; @Maxwell:2020is]. Indeed, empirical results show that well established marine reserve networks can support conservation under climate change [@Rassweiler:2020bp; @Micheli:2012he]. However, more research is needed to understand the effects of MPA design on performance under climate change. On the other hand, sessile species with limited mobility, and those associated with highly vulnerable environments (e.g., located in areas of greater warming) such as tropical coral reefs will still be heavily impacted [@Hughes:2018gh], even if they remain protected. 


## Study Assumptions and Limitations

Due to the global nature of our study we had to make assumptions for all components of the current analysis, and thus, our results are not free of uncertainty. We used a mechanistic species distribution model (the DBEM) to project future species distribution. Despite this being a common tool in biogeography, these types of models do not include species interactions, potential evolutionary adaptation, and are subjected to the original data from which the model distribution was made [@Cheung:2009ud]. Our model is scaled at a $0.5^o$ by $0.5^o$ of the world following previous studies looking at impacts of climate change on marine organisms at the global [@Cheung:2010dt; @ErauskinExtramiana:2019fw] and regional level [@Morley:2018fn]. In cases where MPAs are smaller than the grid cell, we  estimated the proportion of the MPA cover within the grid cell assuming ecological homogeneity (See methods). We acknowledge that this is a strong assumption at the local level, but setting *F* = 0 in each grid cell where an MPA was present would have undoubtedly resulted in an overestimation of the effects of MPA at the global scale. Thus, our results are conservative in this aspect. An important assumption of our study is that all MPAs are effective in protecting biomass, and fishing is assumed to be managed at a MSY level. In reality, MPA effectiveness is case-dependent [@Edgar:2014fia]. Moreover, in some cases the implementation of MPAs can displace fishing effort, often leading to overfishing in surrounding waters, potentially impacting the efficiency of the MPA [@Gilman:2019go]. For the economic analysis we assume that future and present ex-vessel prices are the same, and that the proportion of catch of a species by a particular country will remain the same in the future. Assumptions necessary to use the country-specific prices for each species in the modeled future scenarios. Moreover, our analysis only includes price information for fishes and marine invertebrates in the *Sea Around Us* database, meaning that the value of excluded taxonomic groups (e.g., turtles, marine mammals, corals) is not captured in this analysis. Finally, we also do not take into account other ecological benefits such as increase biodiversity [@Halpern:2003uz] and non-market values of fish, such as values for tourism [@CisnerosMontemayor:2013dv]], because of a lack of available value estimates on a global scale (non-market values of MPAs have been estimated in a number of studies at a local level [@Wallmo:2008ec; @Gill:2015ht]). Even with these uncertainties, this study provides valuable results that will inform critical conservation and management decisions that are occurring on a global scale. There have been recent calls to improve marine conservation management [@Halpern:2014uc; @Edgar:2014fia] and fisheries management [@Gaines:2018sg] in order to achieve sustainability goals under climate change. Our study joins these efforts by showing that MPAs can provide benefits under a changing climate. 

# Conclusion

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals call for the increased global protection of marine ecosystems (SDG 14), which includes understanding the impacts of climate change on MPAs and consequently fisheries revenue. Our study highlights the consequences of climate change on the protection of marine species and the repercussions to society through its impact on revenues from fishing. Our models suggest that existing no-take MPAs cannot fully counteract fish biomass and fisheries revenue losses due to climate change, regardless of the scenario. However, existing MPAs will provide a buffer to biomass and fisheries losses on a regional level and will continue to outperform no-MPA areas as species shift polewards in search of colder waters, even under a high emission scenario. Our study emphasizes the importance of global agreements (e.g., Paris Agreement, UN Conference of Parties, COP 21) to keep global temperature below $2^oC$ [@UnitedNations:eF9vp4KK]. Reaching such a goal will not only benefit marine conservation as shown here, but also marine fisheries and communities that rely on the fisheries as well [@Cheung:2016tt]. The future conservation agenda must consider the impacts of climate change in order to maintain and recover biodiversity in the ocean [@IPBES:2019uk]. Moreover, timing is critical for future meetings such as the COP where Parties will discuss the 2030 goals for the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) [@IISD:2020te]. Thoughtful future designations of MPAs are needed in areas where the effects of climate change may be severe, but also in areas where biomass will most likely be moving in the future.
